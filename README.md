## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

From this project, I gained valuable insights into creating responsive containers and centering them using CSS margin property: 
```CSS
.container {
    margin: auto;
} 
```
and also playing around with hover properties:

```CSS
button:hover {
    background-color: #846a0d;
    color: white;
    cursor:pointer;
}
.profile p:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    font-size: 1.1em;
    cursor:pointer;
}
```
Additionally, I enjoyed enhancing the user experience by setting the font-size using em units. As this project involves a card, it was intriguing to find ways to ensure its stability across various screen sizes.

### Continued development

I aim to enhance my comfort level with flexbox and CSS by experimenting with their properties, given the multitude of functions that require a thorough understanding.
